# Retail Sales Insights Project

Explored in-depth retail sales insights from several shopping malls. This data analysis project covers customer demographics, product categories, sales trends, mall performance, payment methods, and sales growth.

- Analysis idea inspired by Fabian Werkmeister's Project Idea Database [Shopping Data](https://fabianwerkmeister.notion.site/Shopping-Data-64bf50dc0d24409c915853b17a3f7f54).
- Dataset sourced from [Kaggle - Customer Shopping Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset).

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on retail sales data from several shopping malls in Istanbul. The analysis covers a wide range of metrics, including customer demographics, product categories, sales trends, mall performance, payment methods, and sales growth.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the shopping behavior of customers in shopping malls, identify best-selling product categories, and understand sales patterns over time. The analysis also includes metrics related to mall performance and payment method preferences.

## Key Highlights
- **Customer Metrics:** Analyzed customer demographics and provided a breakdown of age and gender distribution among shoppers.
- **Product Metrics:** Identified best-selling product categories and analyzed the quantity of products purchased in each category.
- **Sales Metrics:** Analyzed sales trends on a monthly and yearly basis, both with and without product categorization.
- **Mall Performance Metrics:** Evaluated sales per mall on a yearly and monthly basis, further segmented by product category.
- **Payment Method Analysis:** Explored the frequency of payment methods used by customers, broken down by age and age brackets.
- **Sales Growth Metrics:** Calculated year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter sales growth to identify trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Preparation:** Excel was used for data cleaning, structuring, and reshaping to ensure that the data was well-prepared for in-depth analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** SQL queries were employed to perform the analysis, with descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each query.

## Code Structure
The analysis is organized into SQL queries with descriptive comments, making it easy to understand the purpose of each query. The analysis is well-documented and presented in a structured manner.

## Market Basket Analysis
Note: Although the project initially aimed to include market basket analysis, it was found that the dataset lacks the necessary identifiers (common invoice numbers or customer IDs) to perform this type of analysis. Despite the attempt, it was not possible to conduct a market basket analysis.

## Data Realism and Limitations
The dataset used in this analysis contains uniformly priced products, which may not reflect real-world variations. This is because some synthetic datasets use uniform values for simplicity or anonymization. While this uniform pricing may limit the realism of the data, it is essential to highlight that the analysis techniques and methodologies remain valuable for real-world scenarios.

## Usage
